# Multiple Linear Regression from Scratch (NumPy + Gradient Descent)

A multiple linear regression trainer written in **pure NumPy** — no scikit-learn, no autograd. It standardizes features, minimizes mean squared error with **full-batch gradient descent and early stopping**, checks the result against the closed-form **normal equation**, and reports **MAE, RMSE and R²** through a small fit / predict / score API.

The goal is to understand every piece of the pipeline by writing it by hand, one function at a time.

## Results

On the synthetic demo data in `scaffold.py` (150 samples, 3 features, Gaussian noise σ = 0.1):

| Metric (test set) | Value |
|---|---|
| MAE | 0.092 |
| RMSE | 0.122 |
| R² | 0.9985 |
| L2 gap between GD and normal-equation weights | 0.0059 |
| Epochs before early stopping | 80 / 400 |

Gradient descent lands within 0.006 (L2 distance) of the exact least-squares solution, and early stopping halts training once the validation loss stops improving.

## Quick start

Requires Python 3 and NumPy.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sadokaminbenyahia/numpy-multiple-linear-regression-gd.git
cd numpy-multiple-linear-regression-gd
pip install numpy
python scaffold.py
```

Expected output:

```
Splits: 90 30 30
Sample preds: [-4.9349 -2.1614 -1.1088 -3.5913  1.7047]
Sample trues: [-4.8688 -2.2391 -0.8235 -3.5582  1.6763]
Test MAE/RMSE/R2: {'mae': 0.0922..., 'rmse': 0.1220..., 'r2': 0.9985...}
GD vs normal-eq L2 gap: 0.00586...
```

## Using the model on your own data

```python
import numpy as np
from model import (shuffle_xy, split_train_val_test, create_lr_model,
                   fit_lr_model, predict_lr_model, score_lr_model,
                   compare_with_normal_equation)

X, y = shuffle_xy(X, y, seed=42)
X_tr, y_tr, X_val, y_val, X_te, y_te = split_train_val_test(X, y, 0.6, 0.2)

model = create_lr_model(learning_rate=0.05, epochs=400, patience=25, seed=0)
model = fit_lr_model(model, X_tr, y_tr, X_val, y_val)

y_hat   = predict_lr_model(model, X_te)        # takes raw (unscaled) features
metrics = score_lr_model(model, X_te, y_te)    # {'mae', 'rmse', 'r2'}
gap     = compare_with_normal_equation(model)  # ||w_gd - w_closed||_2
```

The model is a plain dictionary holding the hyperparameters, the learned weights, the normal-equation weights, the training-set mean/std used for scaling, and the per-epoch train/validation losses.

## How it works

### 1. Data preparation
- **Shuffle** rows of `X` and `y` with one shared seeded permutation.
- **Split** into contiguous train / validation / test partitions (60 / 20 / 20 by default).
- **Standardize** each feature using the *training* mean and standard deviation only, so no information leaks from the validation or test sets. Constant features (std = 0) get std = 1 to avoid division by zero.
- **Add a bias column** of ones, so the intercept is learned as the first weight.

### 2. Model and loss

$$\hat{y} = Xw \qquad \text{MSE}(w) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

### 3. Gradient descent

$$\nabla_w \text{MSE} = \frac{2}{n} X^\top(\hat{y} - y) \qquad w \leftarrow w - \eta \, \nabla_w \text{MSE}$$

Weights start from $\mathcal{N}(0,\,0.01)$. Each epoch is one full-batch update, followed by computing train and validation MSE.

### 4. Early stopping
The weights with the lowest validation loss so far are kept. If validation loss fails to improve for `patience` consecutive epochs, training stops and the best weights are returned rather than the last ones.

### 5. Closed-form check

$$w^{*} = X^{+} y$$

computed with the Moore–Penrose pseudo-inverse (`np.linalg.pinv`), which stays stable even when $X^\top X$ is singular. The L2 distance between the GD weights and $w^{*}$ shows how close the iterative solution got to the exact one.

### 6. Evaluation
- **MAE** — mean absolute error
- **RMSE** — root mean squared error, in the same units as the target
- **R²** — share of the target's variance explained by the model (returns `NaN` if the target is constant)

- Plot learning curves with matplotlib using `learning_curve_data`
- Mini-batch or stochastic gradient descent
- L2 (ridge) or L1 (lasso) regularization
- Benchmark against `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression` on a real dataset (e.g. California Housing)
